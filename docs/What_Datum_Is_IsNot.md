# Datum — What It Is / Is Not

## Datum is:
- A single reference point for manufacturing decisions
- A system of record for manufacturing intent
- Transparent about cost, risk, and assumptions
- Revision-controlled and audit-defensible
- Human-authority preserved with enforced rules

## Datum is not:
- A marketplace
- A CM replacement
- A full MES (initially)
- A black box AI
- An auto-executor without approvals
