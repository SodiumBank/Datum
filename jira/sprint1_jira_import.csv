Epic,Sprint 1 – Standards Overlay Engine v1,Activate SOE runtime to produce deterministic compliance decisions without modifying core manufacturing logic,Highest,SOE,"sprint1,soe,reasoning","SOE produces valid SOERun JSON with decisions, gates, and explanations",,
Story,Add SOE schema set to repo,"Add soe.schema.json, rule.schema.json, standards_pack.schema.json, industry_profile.schema.json, and rule_expr.schema.json to /schemas with validation in CI.",Highest,SOE,"schemas,soe","All schemas validate via CI and are referenced correctly by $id",Sprint 1 – Standards Overlay Engine v1
