Epic,Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime,"Deliver a working Standards Overlay Engine runtime (SOE) producing deterministic SOERun outputs from industry profiles + standards packs.",Highest,SOE,"sprint1,soe,mvp","SOE runs end-to-end locally and in CI; produces SOERun with decisions/gates/evidence/why",
Story,CI Unblocker — make CI green,"Fix CI so agents can iterate safely. Ensure ruff/pytest installed for api job; ensure web/ops builds succeed with lockfiles and correct working dirs.",Highest,Platform,"ci,blocking","CI passes on main: api/web/ops jobs succeed",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Define rule_expr.schema.json,"Create rule_expr.schema.json used by rules: operators (equals, in, contains, gt/lt, exists), plus all/any/none composition.",Highest,SOE,"schema,rules","Schema validates; example rule expressions validate; referenced by rule.schema.json",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Implement rule expression evaluator,"Implement evaluator for rule expressions and all/any/none logic. Must be deterministic and unit-tested.",Highest,SOE,"engine,rules","Given same inputs, evaluator returns same boolean; unit tests cover each operator and nesting",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Implement Standards Pack loader,"Load standards packs from standards_packs/ directory; validate pack.json + rules/*.json against schemas; surface friendly errors.",Highest,SOE,"packs,loader","Loader can load Space pack set; invalid JSON fails with clear error; schema validation enforced",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Implement Industry Profile loader,"Load profiles from industry_profiles/; resolve default packs; validate against industry_profile.schema.json.",Highest,SOE,"profiles,loader","Selecting profile resolves default packs and risk posture; schema validated",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,SOE Runtime — build SOERun output,"Create SOERun builder: inputs -> decisions[]/gates[]/required_evidence[]/cost_modifiers[]. Include deterministic decision IDs.",Highest,SOE,"runtime,soe","SOERun produced for a sample Space Flight input; IDs deterministic across runs",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Rule actions — REQUIRE / INSERT_STEP / ADD_GATE,"Implement action handlers for REQUIRE, INSERT_STEP, ADD_GATE. Inserted items must be tagged as SOE-enforced.",Highest,SOE,"enforcement,actions","Rules can force a test + insert a process step + add a release gate; reflected in SOERun",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Rule actions — ADD_COST_MODIFIER / SET_RETENTION,"Implement cost modifiers + retention policies via SOE. Must be traceable to rule_id.",High,SOE,"cost,retention","SOERun includes cost_modifiers[] and required_evidence[] retention derived from rules",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Generate "Why required" explanation strings,"From each decision, generate a human-readable explanation: Industry + hardware_class + rule_id + citations.",High,SOE,"why,audit","Every enforced decision includes why.summary + citations; snapshot stable across runs",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Seed Space v1 minimal ruleset,"Add 6–10 real Space rules: NASA polymerics clean/bake/stake/coat sequencing, TVAC/vibe/shock triggers for Flight, COA requirements, long lead EEE mitigation + A/B testing.",Highest,Standards,"space,pack,rules","Rules validate, evaluate, and produce expected SOERun decisions for sample inputs",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Seed Medical v1 minimal ruleset,"Add 4–6 real Medical rules: IQ/OQ/PQ when new/modified process, DHR evidence bundle, lot traceability, release approvals.",High,Standards,"medical,pack,rules","Rules validate and produce expected SOERun decisions for sample inputs",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Seed Automotive v1 minimal ruleset,"Add 4–6 real Automotive rules: PPAP core docs, lot traceability, SPC/capability triggers for production.",Medium,Standards,"auto,pack,rules","Rules validate and produce expected SOERun decisions for sample inputs",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,API endpoint: POST /soe/evaluate,"Expose evaluation endpoint that accepts context input + selected profile and returns SOERun. Validate request/response with schemas.",High,API,"api,soe","Endpoint returns SOERun; invalid input returns 400 with schema error detail",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
Story,Golden tests: deterministic SOERun snapshots,"Create golden JSON fixtures in /examples and unit tests that compare full SOERun output to expected JSON for Space/Medical/Auto.",Highest,QA,"tests,golden","Tests pass and prove determinism; changes require intentional fixture update",Sprint 1 — SOE MVP Runtime
