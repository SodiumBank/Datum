# Datum

Datum is a manufacturing decision system that establishes a single reference truth from quote through execution.

## What’s inside
- `docs/` PRD + gating + ops console + demo narrative + rules catalog
- `schemas/` JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) for Datum objects

## Next steps
1. Create GitHub repo and add these files
2. Use Cursor to scaffold services and apps per `/docs`
3. Start with Tier 1 (Datum Core): upload → quote → transparency → basic DRC → process outline
