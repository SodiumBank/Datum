# Datum — Tier 1 Demo Narrative (Script)

## Setup
Upload Gerber ZIP + BOM (CSV/XLSX)

## Step 1 — Datum Quote
Say: “Datum establishes a reference point for cost and risk before anything is built.”
Show: cost breakdown, lead-time options, supply-chain flags

## Step 2 — Manufacturing Reality (Tier 1)
Say: “Datum explains what the build will require.”
Show: high-level process outline + basic DRC issues

## Trust Moment
Say: “If this becomes an order, this same reference becomes the plan. No surprises later.”

## Close
Say: “Datum replaces tribal manufacturing knowledge with explicit, reviewable intent.”
Stop.
